    % This research internship aimed to address the reproducibility crisis in artificial intelligence (AI) research by investigating software engineering best practices, open science and accessible AI. To achieve this goal, Yerbamaté framework was developed around the software engineering principles of modularity and separation of concerns. Yerbamaté is an open science modular Python framework designed to streamline and simplify the development and management of machine learning projects. The framework encourages quality coding, collaboration, and the sharing of models, trainers, data loaders, and knowledge, while also promoting reproducibility, customization, and flexibility. The modular design and separation of concerns simplify the development and maintenance of machine learning models, leading to an improved developer experience. The straightforward installation, sharing, and training process makes it accessible to researchers and practitioners with varying technical expertise, enhancing collaboration and knowledge sharing. The findings suggest that the adoption of modular design principles and open science tools can contribute significantly to addressing the reproducibility crisis in AI, leading to more accessible, transparent, and trustworthy AI.
    

In conclusion, the development of the Yerbamaté framework could offer a significant contribution to the field of artificial intelligence by promoting open science and accessible AI. By providing a modular framework that encourages best software engineering practices, Yerbamaté simplifies the development and maintenance of machine learning models, enhancing collaboration and knowledge sharing among researchers and practitioners with varying technical expertise. The framework's ease of use and flexibility enables wider accessibility to artificial intelligence, making it possible for individuals and organizations to develop and train machine learning models with greater ease and efficiency. Overall, the adoption of modular design principles and open science tools has the potential to revolutionize the development and implementation of trustworthy and transparent AI, facilitating innovation and progress in various fields. Nevertheless, the widespread adoption of the Yerbamaté toolkit and other similar tools may pose challenges, including a potential learning curve, implementation overhead, and a need for further refinement and evaluation. One area for future work could be the creation of naming conventions for modules and functions, which could further enhance the modularity and readability of the code. Additionally, comprehensive evaluation and testing of the framework could help to identify any potential issues or areas for improvement, ensuring the continued effectiveness and usefulness of the Yerbamaté toolkit.
