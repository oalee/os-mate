\section{Introduction}


 In recent years, AI has made remarkable progress, finding numerous applications across various fields such as natural language (\cite{gpt}), general intelligence(\cite{gato}), art (\cite{diffusion}), music (\cite{musiclm}), healthcare (\cite{aihealthcare}), finance (\cite{bao2022fraudartificial}), education (\cite{aieducation}), and weather forecasting (\cite{weather}). The potential benefits of AI are immense (\cite{beneficialai,potencialaibenefit}), their development and deployment require quality data (\cite{lecun2015deep}), code, and sound software engineering practices (\cite{se4dl,amershi2019software}). Poor software engineering practices can lead to a reproducibility crisis, undermining the reliability and credibility of AI systems (\cite{leakage-recrisis}). On the other hand, good software engineering practices can enhance the developer experience, reliability, maintainability, and replicability of AI systems (\cite{se4dl,amershi2019software, wan2019does}). In order to realize the full potential of AI, researchers and practitioners require open source tools and frameworks that are user-friendly, customizable, and promote reproducibility in the development of AI projects (\cite{lu2022softwareAIReponse,li2018can,wolf2020designing,olson2018system,ong2021guide,gundersen2018reproducible}). This is particularly important for ensuring that the benefits of AI are accessible to all and that the development of AI aligns with open science and ethical principles, enabling the sharing of research findings and supporting the progress and implementation of diverse AI applications for societal benefits (\cite{coro2020open,braun2018open, mittelstadt2016ethics,floridi2018ai4people,ong2021guide}).

The Yerbamate framework embodies a novel approach to open science and python development, showcasing a python modular project structure and software engineering design that enhances developer experience, reproducibility, reusability, transparency, and collaboration in the research community.
The framework incorporates contemporary open science, combining open source and open science methodologies by leveraging version control (git) for sharing reusable code modules and community-based discussion platforms for open access to open science work of Yerbamate including open question answering, feedback, and issue tracking. The framework is subject to continuous updates and refinements to address limitations, enhance the developer experience, and ensure its dependability and functionality. 
% The Yerbamate framework has the potential for further expansion and refinement, providing opportunities to augment its functionality with more dependable, searchable and queryable models to boost its utility for researchers.
