This study aimed to address the knowledge gap in software engineering for AI by developing a framework that prioritizes open science and improves the developer experience. 

\subsection{Open Science}


The methodology of open science in this work encompasses the development of the open-source framework Yerbamate\footnote{\url{https://github.com/oalee/yerbamate}} and the creation of an open science report\footnote{\url{https://github.com/oalee/os-yerbamate}} for Yerbamate. Both repositories' progress history is publicly available, and the repositories provide open access to contributions, question answers, ideas, and discussions using a platform to enhance open science and encourage collaboration. A Medium article titled "The Ultimate Deep Learning Project Structure: A Software Engineer’s Guide into the Land of AI"\footnote{\url{https://medium.com/@alee.rmi/c383f234fd2f}} has been published to disseminate knowledge of software engineering in a more accessible manner, incorporating humor and memes with the aim of enhancing learning (\cite{powell1985humour}).
This tutorial provides a simple and easy-to-understand introduction to software engineering for AI, explaining modularity and its application in the context of AI. Detailed documentation of the API and usage can be found on our repository\footnote{\url{https://oalee.github.io/yerbamate}}. The Yerbamate framework and its associated open-source repositories are continuously updated to address limitations, bugs, and improve developer experience. These updates ensure that the framework remains current and reliable, while also incorporating feedback from the AI research community to further enhance its functionality and utility. Additionally, more tutorials will be added in the future with enough resources to promote open science.

\subsection{Framework Design}

The methodology for developing this framework involved analyzing existing open-source python AI projects, reviewing the literature on software engineering practices, and studying modularity, separation of concerns, and open science in AI. The resulting framework prioritizes the creation of independent modules that are standalone and reusable components, which can be used across different projects.

\subsubsection{Experiment Configuration}

Defining hyperparameters and experiments plays a crucial role in AI development and optimization \cite{wu2019hyperparameter}. After evaluating various formats, it was decided that Python is the most suitable format for defining experiments in AI python projects due to its expressiveness, versatility, and straightforward syntax. The integration of existing code and libraries in Python reduces overhead and enhances the experimentation process. Python's powerful libraries and modules enable the exploration of a wider range of hyperparameters and models, leading to a more comprehensive understanding of the problem at hand. The use of well-documented Python code improves the readability of the configuration file, making it more accessible. Additionally, the format is executable directly with Python, which makes it Turing complete, capable of expressing any algorithm, enhancing its flexibility and power.




\subsection{Evaluation}

The Yerbamaté framework was tested on various open-source AI projects across different frameworks and libraries, including Jax, Flax, Pytorch, Pytorch\-Lightning, Tensorflow, Keras, and Huggingface, to evaluate its effectiveness. The framework's flexibility was demonstrated through various use cases, such as particle swarm optimization (\cite{kennedy1995particle}) and a computer vision experiment with RANSAC (\cite{lowe2004distinctive}). Furthermore, the framework's effectiveness was evaluated through a case study involving the refactoring of the official implementation of Big Transfer (BiT) to conform to modularity. Code samples, installable modules, examples, and the results of the case study are available in the Appendix.
