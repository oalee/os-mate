The author acknowledges the invaluable contributions of the open source and open science community, including the developers of tools, libraries, and frameworks such as Jax, Keras, PyTorch, HuggingFace, and many others, as well as researchers and developers who contribute to open source projects. The author expresses gratitude to all the open source code that has been forked and utilized in the development of Yerbamaté. Without these contributions, this work would not be possible.


The author acknowledges the contributors of open source framework Maté\footnote{\url{https://github.com/ilex-paraguariensis/yerbamate}}, an AI experimentation framework that underwent various design developments and testing from June 2022 onwards. Due to laws at Maastricht University that prohibit collaborations in research internships, the project was forked into Yerbamaté as an individual effort to enhance flexibility. The author acknowledges the contributions of Giulio Zani, the developer of the Maté project.
The author also expresses gratitude to their supervisors, Iris Groen of the University of Amsterdam and Mirela Popa of Maastricht University, for their guidance and support. 


The contributions and progress of the development of the Yerbamaté framework are presented in the git commit history as an alt-metric, and progress can be tracked using a contribution analyses tool.\footnote{\url{https://github.com/oalee/yerbamate/graphs/contributors}}
