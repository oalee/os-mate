The author acknowledges the open source community, tools, libraries, and frameworks, as well as the various open source AI projects that made the development of the Yerbamaté framework possible. Without these contributions, this work would not be possible.

The Maté framework began as a tool for AI experimentation in June 2022 and was further developed in the following months. Due to prohibitive laws at Maastricht University, which restrict collaborations in research internships, the project was forked as an individual effort, resulting in the creation of the Yerbamaté framework.

The contributions of Giulio Zani to the open source project called Maté are also acknowledged. The Yerbamaté framework was designed to be flexible and extensible, with the goal of promoting open science and improving the developer experience. 

The author would also like to express gratitude to the supervisors, Iris Goren of UVA and Mirela Popa of Maastricht University, for their guidance and support. Finally, the author acknowledges the many sample projects in the appendix, which are forked from Giulio Zani's repositories. Moreover, the contribution of code to this project is presented as an altmetric in Figure X.

\section{Conclusion}



    % This research internship aimed to address the reproducibility crisis in artificial intelligence (AI) research by investigating software engineering best practices, open science and accessible AI. To achieve this goal, Yerbamaté framework was developed around the software engineering principles of modularity and separation of concerns. Yerbamaté is an open science modular Python framework designed to streamline and simplify the development and management of machine learning projects. The framework encourages quality coding, collaboration, and the sharing of models, trainers, data loaders, and knowledge, while also promoting reproducibility, customization, and flexibility. The modular design and separation of concerns simplify the development and maintenance of machine learning models, leading to an improved developer experience. The straightforward installation, sharing, and training process makes it accessible to researchers and practitioners with varying technical expertise, enhancing collaboration and knowledge sharing. The findings suggest that the adoption of modular design principles and open science tools can contribute significantly to addressing the reproducibility crisis in AI, leading to more accessible, transparent, and trustworthy AI.
