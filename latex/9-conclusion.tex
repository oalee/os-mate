\section{Conclusion}



    % This research internship aimed to address the reproducibility crisis in artificial intelligence (AI) research by investigating software engineering best practices, open science and accessible AI. To achieve this goal, Yerbamaté framework was developed around the software engineering principles of modularity and separation of concerns. Yerbamaté is an open science modular Python framework designed to streamline and simplify the development and management of machine learning projects. The framework encourages quality coding, collaboration, and the sharing of models, trainers, data loaders, and knowledge, while also promoting reproducibility, customization, and flexibility. The modular design and separation of concerns simplify the development and maintenance of machine learning models, leading to an improved developer experience. The straightforward installation, sharing, and training process makes it accessible to researchers and practitioners with varying technical expertise, enhancing collaboration and knowledge sharing. The findings suggest that the adoption of modular design principles and open science tools can contribute significantly to addressing the reproducibility crisis in AI, leading to more accessible, transparent, and trustworthy AI.
